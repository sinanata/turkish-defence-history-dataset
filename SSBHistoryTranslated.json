As of 1921, military production and repair works in various regions of the country were managed from a single center by the Directorate General of Military Factories. Mustafa Kemal Ataturk expressed the point reached by the Turkish defense industry within just a few years with the following words in his opening speech to the Grand National Assembly on March 1, 1922: \"Today, it is possible to produce all kinds of necessities. Preparation and production of large quantities of artillery and infantry ammunition and bombs have been ensured in newly established bullet and cartridge factories. Many tools and equipment such as modern communication tools and fortification vehicles have been added to the army ranks by telegraphs.\" Efforts towards establishing a national defense industry continued in the early years of the Republic with the activation of many factories, institutions, and organizations, particularly in the aviation field.</p>",

The plans for the aircraft and gliders produced in the factory were drawn by Turkey's first aircraft engineer and inventor, Selahattin Re\u015fit Alan. In the year the factory was established, the first single-engine aircraft, Nu. D-36, was produced, and two years later, in 1938, the double-engine, six-passenger capacity Nu. D-38 was manufactured. The Nu. D-38 model, which was produced in mass, was classified as a \"Class A passenger aircraft\" by the World Aviation Authority in 1944. This plane, which could reach speeds of 325 km/h, could cover a distance of 1,000 km. Aircraft orders were placed with the factory from the Turkish Aeronautical Association and various European countries starting in 1938.</p>",

Although attempts towards this goal increased after the operation, developments in the domestic defense industry primarily gained momentum in the mid-1980s. With the establishment of SAGEB in 1985 and its restructuring as SSM in 1989, these efforts began to yield results from the 1990s onwards. During these years, the development of the Turkish defense industry gained significant momentum, and a significant portion of the TSK's needs were met with local and national resources.",

It was designed to be used in training for firing with various missile systems and tracking with radar, which can detect the location and distance of objects by picking up the echoes of radio waves, using a mechanism with propulsion-producing engines and a geometry that reduces air friction. Additionally, efforts are underway to convert \u015e\u0130M\u015eEK into a cruise missile with a jet engine propulsion system that can be used against land and sea targets and has the ability to fly straight at a fixed speed.</p>",
